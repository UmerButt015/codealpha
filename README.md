The Iris Flower Classification project aims to automatically identify the species of iris flowers-setosa, versicolor, or virginica-based on their sepal and petal measurements. This classic machine learning problem uses a well-known dataset containing four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
